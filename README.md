# CodeLouisvilleFinalProjectAho
Benjamin Aho's Final Project for Code Louisville

Course Requirements:

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- Master Loop is implemented in the Main Menu in the Main Namespace.

Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
- The inheriting class is seen in the name BaseClass. NewProject and UserInput both inherit from the Name namespace and pass userName and projectName through to case 1 and case 2 of the switch case in the main menu in the Main Namespace.

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- Both case 1 and case 2 use lists that are both used in foreach loops on case three and four.
