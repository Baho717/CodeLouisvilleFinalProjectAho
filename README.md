Benjamin Aho's Final Project for Code Louisville


Project Explanation: 
For my final project, I created an app for people who work as freelancers. It allows the user to create a user profile, create new project, view current projects, and view these project's timelines. The menu is controlled by the command line.

Future Plans:
In the second half of this course, I plan to add an option to archive projects, generate contracts, and send payment reminder emails to clients.  

Course Requirements:

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- The Master Loop is implemented in the Main Menu in the MainMenu Namespace.

Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
- The inheriting class is seen in the NAME BaseClass. NewProject and UserInput both inherit from the Name namespace and pass "userName" and "projectName" through to cases 1 and 2 of the switch case of the Main Namespace. These are later used in the lists.

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- Both cases 1 and 2 use lists that are implemented in foreach loops on case three and four.
